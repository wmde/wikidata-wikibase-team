# Tech Backlog

The tech backlog is primarily maintained on the [wdwb-tech workboard](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/project/board/3532/), and managed by the prioritization session and Tech Lead.

## Prioritization session

The prioritization sessions focus around a [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sa4x3XYqpK1v6s4HnIIKq327UVYXd38PpDyT-7PqtCo) and a fairly objective scoring system (detailed below).

If a significant product / user-facing concern is raised during the prioritization process, the task is not prioritized and instead handed to PMs.
Tech tasks with minor user impact may still be prioritized through the tech backlog, possibly in addition to product prioritization.

:::details Session leader guide

**Before the session**

- If there are not many tasks to discuss, check the `wdwb-tech` board and add some tasks from the inbox or backlog
- If tasks have been picked up by a team, archive them (adding the archived date)
- Make sure the sheet is sorted & presentable

**During the session**

- Introduce any people unfamiliar with the process to the process
- Introduce the sheet changes, if any have been made you are aware of
- Start by introducing, scoring and discussing a task that you have brought to the session
- Repeat the process, picking who goes next if tasks were brought, or poking to see who might want to represent a ticket. (Mix around who talks)

**Throughout the session**

- As people talk about their task:
  - Make the task as "Prioritzed" if it was missed
  - Populate the "Prioritized date" column
- If a task it already done, mark it as archived & set the archive date, leaving a note on the reason for archiving
- If a task has significant negative user/product impact, or needs other PM input, mark it as pending, leaving a note as to why
- As people comment on how the scoring system is good or bad, leave comments in cells to be tackled at the end of the month

**After the session**

- Click the "Sort the sheet" button
- Move all tasks to the appropriate columns on the `wdwb-tech` board
- Message PMs for any needed input, or tasks that are now on their plate
- Message EMs for any high prio "big" tasks that have appeared

:::

:::details Session attendee guide

**Before the session**

- Add any tasks that you or your team have come across and want to prioritize and represent to the sheet
  - Create a new row in the Discuss section, below the pending section (top of the sheet)
  - Copy all formula for columns marked with a âš¡
  - Fill in the first green columns
    - Phabricator task ID
    - Set the Status to "Discuss"
    - Enter your name in the "Brought by" column
- If you feel comfortable with the scoring system score these in advance (It's fine to do this in the call too)

**During the session**

- When others are representing tasks:
  - Get an understanding of the task, what it means, what it aims to do and why.
  - Provide feedback about the scores other participants gave to the tasks that they are presenting.

- When called on:
  - Introduce your ticket, giving people context to understand what it is, and why you are brining it
  - Run through the scores from left to right, ending with an effort estimation
  - Ask the round for feedback on your scores
  - Mark the status to prioritized, set the session week, and set the prioritized date
:::

:::details Tech lead monthly guide

Each month, to keep sheet size down and speed up a new sheet should be created.

- Current "Active" sheet is duplicated, and the duplicate renammed as an archive copy of the current state.
- All cells on the new archive sheet are copied and pasted using the "with values" feature, which will remove all formula.
- All comments on the new Active sheet are tended to, including changes to the scoring system.
- All archived task rows are deleted from the new "Active" sheet.

### Details

#### States

States are numbered to aid in sorting and visibility on the sheet.

- 1 - **Pending**: Generally on the radar of the session, but might not be discussed in the next session.
- 2 - **Discuss**: Try and discuss in the next session.
- 3.3 - **Prioritized**: Already been through the process and acquired a score.
- 3.2 - **Prio Bigger**: Already been through the process and acquired a score. But estimated at more 2 or more weeks work, so not fitting for a simple Campsite or Team pickup. Must be funneled into initiatives for the EMs.
- 3.1 - **Bigger Batch**: Not neccesarily been through the process, but these tasks make sense to bundle with other bigger tasks, or as a set of small things. Must be funneled into initiatives for the EMs.
- 4 - **Archived**: Is closed, or picked up by a team.

#### Scoring

Ultimately the score is a single number, and the backlog is sorted using that number. This was inspired by [RICE](https://roadmunk.com/guides/rice-score-prioritization-framework-product-management/) and [User Pain](https://lostgarden.home.blog/2008/05/20/improving-bug-triage-with-user-pain/).

```
( SUM OF IMPACT ) * ( 1 + SUM OF REACH ) * ( ( EFFORT WEIGHT + WEEK MODIFIER ) * 10 ) / 4
```

- **SUM OF IMPACT**: Aims to prioritize on key things that we care about. This is a SUM of impacts from both team focuses (includes some duplication)
- **SUM OF REACH**: Aims to prioritize things that have a broader reaching impact or that more folks care about
- **EFFORT WEIGHT**: Aims to prioritize higher impact lower effort things first
- **WEEK MODIFIER**: Aims to give new things a tiny decimal edge, so that we don't have ties

As the score makeup evolves the higher end pickup mark should aim to stay around 100+ (which is why the current score is `/4`
